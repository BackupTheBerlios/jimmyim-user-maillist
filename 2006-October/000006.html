<PRE>Hi and thanks for your reply!

I've doublechecked my login/password now and it's correct. I now also 
tried with the same account that I'm usually using on my desktop and then 
I observed that my desktop Live Messenger client gets disconnected when I 
attempt to connect from my mobile, but I still recieve the &quot;Failed to 
connect!&quot; message. I reconnected three times just to make sure it wasn't a 
coincidence and my desktop got disconnected each time.

That kinda proves that JimmyIM does connect to the MSNP server and 
successfully authenticates (as my desktop gets disconnected), but after 
that something fails.

I'll be glad to help out. I just need some time to get confortable with 
Java and the development tools. I usually develop in C, VisualBasic and a 
little C# so Java is new to me. But as soon as I manage to compile the 
package it should be fairly easy to start debugging it and pinpoint the 
problem...

&gt;<i> All tools you need are available for free:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - one of many Java IDEs(Netbeans with Mobility Pack or Eclipse)
</I>
I've downloaded and installed the following:

JDK 5.0 Update 9 with NetBeans 5.0
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download-netbeans.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download-netbeans.html</A>

Sun Java Wireless Toolkit 2.5 for CLDC
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download-2_5.html">http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download-2_5.html</A>

Eclipse SDK 3.2.1
<A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</A>

EclipseME 1.5.5
<A HREF="http://eclipseme.org/">http://eclipseme.org/</A>


I've managed to install EclipseME in Eclipse and extracted your source zip 
file and imported the source tree in Eclipse. The first problem I ran into 
was that it complained about:

The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. Cannot find 
the class file for java.lang.Object. Fix the build path then try building 
this project

The type java.lang.Object cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced 
from required .class files


I managed to solve that by adding JRE System Library under

Project-&gt;Properties-&gt;Java Build Path-&gt;Libraries-&gt;Add Library

however, now it complains just about everything that it can't be resolved. 
In the same dialog that I added JRE System Library I can see a reference 
to J2ME library but it sais:

J2ME library (failed to get libraby information)
   Access rules: No rules defined
   Native library location: (None)


That seems to me like the Wireless toolkit or something with EclipseME 
hasn't been installed correct.

Any hints?


&gt;<i> - how to download our source with svn:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=6384">http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=6384</A>
</I>
I'll switch to SVN when I've learned to compile the thing :-)
