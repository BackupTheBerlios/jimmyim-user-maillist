</I>An alternative is NetBeans with mobility pack. However, problems with
debuging were present on my computer only. Others using Eclipse were
debuging fine. If I were launching the application with the play button
(not the bug button), it worked though.

Did you try running the jad manually with emulator? (emulator.exe should
be located in your j2me wireless toolkit I think or even in java dir -
under Linux).
