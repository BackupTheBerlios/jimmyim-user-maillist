I'm trying two diffrent tracks right now and I'm kinda stuck on both :-)

1) Running it from within Eclipse using the emulator.
2) Exporting to a JAR file and run manually in the emulator.


Problem #1 is still stuck as above on the error &quot;Bad version information&quot;. 
Is there any reference in the source or some desc file that refers to the 
version of Java or the wireless toolkit you used that I might need to 
change to match the versions I'm using?


Problem #2, I'm not really confident with how to create the .jar and .jad 
file properly. I rightclick the project and select Export and then 
Java-&gt;JAR file.

I'm seeing a number of problems.

a) At the end of the export wizard I'm asked to enter &quot;Select the class of 
the application entry point&quot;, but when I click Browse the window is empty 
and even if I manually writes &quot;jimmy&quot; there it complains about that the 
class is not selected for export or has no main method.

b) If I extract the created jar file and looks in the MANIFEST.MF file it 
only contains

Manifest-Version: 1.0

while the MANIFEST.MF file in your jar file contains alot more info. This 
causes the emulator to halt when I try to run my jar file with the 
following error:

com.sun.kvem.midletsuite.InvalidJadException: Reason = 13
The file Manifest is missing the required attribute: MIDlet-Name

So, the question is how do I make Eclipse include the project details in 
the exported manifest file?

c) How do I create the .jad file. I'm currently using your .jad file and 
simply modiles the size attribute to match my jar file.


d) I can see in the source zip file there is a build.xml file that seems 
to hold the attributes I need to put in the manifest file. How do I use 
that xml file to build the .jar/.jad file?


Sorry for all these qustions, but right now I just feel like a big 
question mark and am not sure really where to dig for more info about 
these problems..

Cheers / Mathias
